        <hr>
        <p>I'm Ethan, the creator of StudioBros! I created it because I have a passion for music production, and the only DAW that fits my budget and workflow is FL. It's easy to get started with, and a versatile tool for masters.</p>
        <p>I use FL Studio 21.0 Producers' Edition. I sell my music on a service called Bandcamp for growing artists. I also make Black MIDIs for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@musikid_official">my YouTube channel, Musikid</a>.</p>
